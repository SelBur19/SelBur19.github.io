    <h2>Were do dolphins live?</h2>
	<p>Dolphins live in the Pacific ocean; the Atlantic ocean; the Indian ocean; rivers and seas and in threats.Some of the dolphins that live in the Pacific ocean are: bottlenose, spinner, and Pacific white-sided dolphins. These species are better adapted to tolerating cold water than their shore-loving counterparts.the Atlantic ocean is the preferred home of bottlenose, humpback, and spotted dolphins.The Indian Ocean is the native environment for large numbers of bottlenose, spinner, and common dolphins. We are used to seeing dolphins in the oceans, but there are also dolphins in rivers and seas. In the amazon river there are dolphins which are very small.
    Dolphins are highly endangered by various factors, especially climate change, pollution, etc. Therefore there are many different causes, which take care of the protection of dolphins.  </p>

    <p>Dolphins can recognize each other by their unique whistle. They communicate with each other through the ears and not through the eyes.<img src="Bild1.jpg">This is   called ecolocation. Dolphins can even adjust the signal strength. In a noisy sea, the signals should be louder than in a calm sea. Dolphins can not breathe unconsciously like humans.<img src="Bild4.jpg"> They think before they perform breathing, so they pull their body grandmother out to draw water. But when they sleep they do not die, because half of their body sleeps, while the other half stays above the water and thus they are safe.<img src="Bild3.jpg"> When a dolphin is injured the other dolphins help and hold the dolphin's body above the water until it reaches the right place.</p>
